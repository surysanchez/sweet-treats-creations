# Sweet Treats Creations

###### Inspired about helping grow my cousin's small business , I developped a special and detailed website , where all visitants and users are able to view multiple differents treats and custom surprises available to enjoy on any ocassion .

###### Once you are on the app , you can create an account , and you'll have acces to create your tailored cakes . Later on , users we'll have a page showing all their recent treats . They can also update and delete their customized cakes .

###### In addition _Sweet Treats Creations_ offers a diversed catalog containing desserts , perfect for Stay Home celebrations, birthdays, intimate gatherings, office parties, graduations, anniversaries, holidays and more.
